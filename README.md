**Slime Brief Description:**
1. *Wood Slimes act like any other slime, they should be safe and the most common.**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. *Glue Slimes are pretty normal as well, but they're alternate food sources could result to Pink Slimes or Pink Plorts. Explains why they spawn in the Reef.*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. *Glass Slimes have not much to say about them besides that sometimes they'll float, they also like meat.*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. *Metal Slimes used to look like Tarr Slimes, but morphed into a cute little slime. They may or may not eat their own Plorts or a Rock Slime if there is no other food source.*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. *Plastic Slimes are sneaky, they'll go into stealth mode(invisible) for a second, then jump right at you! Although, they are very nice creatures.. but may eat a glue plort or two if hungry.*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. *Self Discovery Slimes are probably the most powerful out of them all, when it eats.. it'll spawn/summon a Material Slime, only one though. Explains the name, right? It'll discover a slime for you. They also like eating Kookadoba's or Tarrs. Feeding them Tarrs come with risk.*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possibly more slimes to be added in the future! Also, Tarrs will not eat any of the Material Slimes.. as of now. Although, they will still run away from them.. besides the Self Discovery Slime. They will go towards it for food, and once it is satisfied it will just jump around happily as if its all fine.
